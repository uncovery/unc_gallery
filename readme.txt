A simple, self-generating, auto-tagging, date-based gallery with bulk uploading, perfect for photo blogging.

== Description ==

This plugin specializes in displaying all photos of a certain date or between any two points in time.
It takes away the need to handle each photo individually. The admin can simply
upload all images in a batch and the system will recognise the date and time the pictures were taken.

The galleries are then displayed by inserting a short code into any wordpress element
such as posts or pages in the basic format [unc_gallery date="2006-03-30"].

This plugin is specially made for photo bloggers who often often post several images of a certain event
such as a hike, a trip, a dive or concert without having to touch every single image individually.

Kaywords added in Adobe Lightroom etc. can be directly used on the website to tag photos and posts.

Additional features include:

* featured photos: show one or more photos larger than others
* dynamic dates: show the latest, first or random dates
* date picker: let the user pick the date themselves
* seamless re-uploading: any photo can be re-uploaded anytime with a better/different version
* EXIF data: The photo description can show automatically generated photo data such as ISO, F-stop etc.

1. The admin screen does not have any tabs as in your screenshot, everything is just a list.
This happens when there is an error in the code before the tabs can be loaded. Please take a look at your website logfile and look for the error.
If the error is generated by this plug-in, please let me know and I will do my best to fix it.
