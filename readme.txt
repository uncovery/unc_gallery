A simple, self-generating, date-based gallery with bulk uploading

== Description ==

This plugin specializes in displaying all photos of a certain date or between any two points in time.
It takes away the need to handle each photo individually. The admin can simply
upload all images in a batch and the system will recognise the date and time the pictures were taken.

The galleries are then displayed by inserting a short code into any wordpress element
such as posts or pages in the basic format [unc_gallery date="2006-03-30"].

This plugin is specially made for photo bloggers often often post several images of a certain event
such as a hike, a trip, a dive or concert without having to touch every single image individually.

Additional features include:

* featured photos: show one or more photos larger than others
* dynamic dates: show the latest, first or random dates
* date picker: let the user pick the date themselves
* seamless re-uploading: any photo can be re-uploaded anytime with a better/different version
* EXIF data: The photo description can show automatically generated photo data such as ISO, F-stop etc.
