A simple, self-generating, date-based gallery with bulk uploading

== Description ==

This plugin specializes in displaying photos of a certain date or a certain time
of a single day. It takes away the need to handle each photo individually. The
admin can simply upload all images in a batch and they will be automatically
sorted by date.

The galleries are then displayed by inserting a short code into any wordpress element
such as posts or pages in the basic format [unc_gallery date="2006-03-30"].

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/unc_gallery` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
