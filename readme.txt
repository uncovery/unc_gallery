Creates date-based photo galleries.

== Description ==

This plugin specializes in displaying photos of a certain date or a certain time
of a single day. It takes away the need to handle each photo individually. The
admin can simply upload all images in a batch and they will be automatically
sorted by date.

The galleries are then displayed by inserting a short code into any wordpress element
such as posts or pages in the basic format [unc_gallery date="2006-03-30"].


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/unc_gallery` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Uncovery Gallery screen to configure it and upload photos

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
