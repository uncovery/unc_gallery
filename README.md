# Uncovery Gallery
A Wordpress-plugin that displays photo galleries.

== General Info ==

This plugin specializes in displaying photos of a certain date or a certain time
of a single day. It takes away the need to handle each photo individually. The
admin can simply upload all images in a batch and they will be automatically
sorted by date.

The galleries are then displayed by inserting a short code into any wordpress element
such as posts or pages in the basic format [unc_gallery date="2006-03-30"].

One key advantage of this system is that you can remove individual photos and
they will disappear without errors from the whole page (unless they have been
featured somewhere) and you can also re-upload photos and overwrite old ones in
case you changed them without going through complicated admin pages.

== Features ==

* Time shift: If photos are generally also taken after midnight, a time shift
can be applied to all photos to make sure they do not appear as photos of the next day.
* Photo and Thumbnail resizing: The admin can choose the quality and size of thumbnails.

There are several additional options beyond this basic format:

* Time Limits: Define a specific time span during the day to be displayed instead of
the whole day
* Featured photo: Display one photo at the start and larger than the other photos
* One Photo only: Show only one photo of one day. Either a specific photo, random,
the first or latest
* Dynamic date: Instead of showing a specific date, show random, first or latest
* Descriptions: Whole days or individual photos can have specific description
set in the short code
